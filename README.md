Week 5. This was my first introduction to arrays, enums, and structs. With guidance I was able to implement these concepts 
in a way that allowed me to avoid writing individual methods for every circumstance. Instead I was able to 
refactor my code so that the same code could be implemented between all similar circumstances. (Class assignment)
